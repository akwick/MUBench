description: When configured to use the JCE (Java Cryptography Extension) for cryptographic functions, Bouncy Castle prior to version 1.0.3 is susceptible to a chosen ciphertext attack when negotiating an RSA key exchange for any TLS cipher suite. A man-in-the-middle attacker could potentially decrypt HTTPS traffic or impersonate the HTTPS server. This vulnerability is referred to as ROBOT (Return Of Bleichenbacher's Oracle Threat).
