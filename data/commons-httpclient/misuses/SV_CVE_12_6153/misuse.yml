description: http/conn/ssl/AbstractVerifier.java in Apache Commons HttpClient does not properly verify that the server hostname matches a domain name in the subject's Common Name (CN) or subjectAltName field of the X.509 certificate, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof SSL servers via a certificate with a subject that specifies a common name in a field that is not the CN field

  file: org/apache/http/conn/ssl/AbstractVerifier.java
  method: "getCNs(X509Certificate)"
